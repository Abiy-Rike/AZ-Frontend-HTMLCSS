   <p>This is my first HTML project on <b>Cohort 4</b>. The purpose of this page is to <u>demonstrate my skills</u> so far.</p>

   <p>In the next <b>five years</b>, my primary goal as a frontend developer student is to achieve mastery in core 
    frontend technologies such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I aim to become <em>proficient in creating 
     well-structured, responsive, and visually appealing web applications</em> that deliver an exceptional
    user experience. As I progress in my studies, I plan to delve into advanced frontend frameworks
    and libraries like <em>React</em>, <em>Angular</em>, or <em>Vue.js</em>. By gaining expertise in these technologies, I aim 
    to build complex and interactive user interfaces while adhering to best practices and design patterns.
    A key aspect of being a proficient frontend developer <u>is ensuring cross-browser compatibility and
    optimizing website performance</u>. Over the next five years, I aspire to <strong>master techniques</strong> for <em>optimizing
    loading times, reducing resource usage, and ensuring smooth performance</em> across different browsers and devices.
     I believe in the importance of making web applications accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities. 
     In the coming years, I intend to become well-versed in accessibility standards and inclusive design principles,
      ensuring that the websites and applications I develop are <strong>usable and enjoyable</strong> by everyone.</p>
