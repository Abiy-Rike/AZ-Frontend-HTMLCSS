    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary field in computer science that aims to imbue machines with human-like intelligence and decision-making capabilities. It involves the creation of algorithms and models that enable computers to simulate human cognitive processes such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and language understanding. One of the key components of AI is machine learning, where computers are trained to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning: This subset of AI focuses on designing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are common techniques used in machine learning.</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It plays a crucial role in applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and speech recognition.</li>
        <li>Computer Vision: This branch of AI equips computers with the ability to interpret and understand visual information from the world, similar to how humans perceive images and videos. Computer vision finds applications in facial recognition, object detection, medical image analysis, and autonomous vehicles.</li>
